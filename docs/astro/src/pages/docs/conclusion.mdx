-   Astro does deliver a great DX regardless of your level of experience, as building Astro components only really requires HTML and CSS.
-   Astro is UI-agnostic, meaning you can **BYOF** it and bring your own framework. They have official support for React, Preact, Solid, Svelte, Vue, and Lit. You can even mix and match different frameworks.
-   Astro shines with statically generated content. Even if there is no [SSR or ISR like Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/overview), Astro is considering per-page support for SSR in their [2022 Q4 roadmap](https://github.com/withastro/rfcs/discussions/302).
-   Astro can ship ZERO JS (you'd be surprised how many things can be achieved with only HTML and CSS). Regardless if you need to introduce [Astro Islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/) and UI frameworks, it loads [40% faster with 90% less JavaScript](https://twitter.com/t3dotgg/status/1437195415439360003) in comparison to modern frameworks.
