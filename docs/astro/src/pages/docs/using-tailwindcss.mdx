## All your styles in a single line

The official Tailwind CSS Typography plugin provides a set of prose classes you can use to add style defaults to any vanilla HTML you don’t control, like HTML rendered from Markdown, or pulled from a CMS with a single line of code. If we'd go back and add a couple of classes to our `src/layouts/Page.astro` layout file it would be enough to apply these styling defaults.

```jsx
---
const { frontmatter: title } = Astro.props;
---
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>{title}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <main class="min-h-screen max-w-6xl mx-auto">
      <article class="prose lg:prose-xl">
        <h1>{title}</h1>
          <slot />
        </div>
      </article>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Styling individual HTML elements

There are plenty of [element modifiers](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin#element-modifiers) that you can use to add utility classes to style individual elements. Additionally, we'd recommend adding: `dark:prose-invert`, which triggers hand-designed dark mode versions for every default color theme.

## How to use CSS in Astro

Styling an Astro component is as easy as adding a `<style>` tag in any `*.astro` file, where they are automatically **scoped by default**. You can also opt-out of scoping by adding the `is:global` attribute. If you aren't using TailwindCSS, advance styling languages like [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Less](https://lesscss.org/) are also supported. 

Say we want to change the look of an HTML element, even if we aren't authoring traditional CSS for our `<a>` and `<pre>` elements, could do something like this :

```jsx
<style>
    .prose * > a {
        @apply no-underline border-b-2 pb-1 hover:pb-2 transition-all;
    }
    .prose pre {
        @apply p-5 drop-shadow-2xl;
    }
</style>
```

**Don't abuse `@apply` just for the sake of making things look "cleaner"**. As Tailwind recommends: If you’re going to use `@apply`, use it for very small, highly reusable things like buttons and form controls — and even then only if you’re not using a framework like React where a component would be a better choice.
