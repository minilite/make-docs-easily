## Working with Astro's toolbox

Astro's Runtime APIs is what really brings all of its power together. For example, we have been using `Astro.props` all along to read all the attributes passed as component props. You can browse their documentation to learn more about their APIs, see [API Reference](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/api-reference/).

For now, let's introduce more of their APIs to build a _Table of contents_ and a _Side navigatation_ component.

### Building a Table of contents

`Astro.props` is an object containing any values that have been passed as attributes. In addition to its `frontmatter` object, a **Markdown layout** will have access to the default props, such as `url` and `headings` among others (see [Markdown Layout Props](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#markdown-layout-props)). 

Excluding the `frontmatter` object, which we have already talked about, let's log the entire `Astro.props` to understand how easy Astro makes this information available to use:

```js
{
  file: '.../src/pages/docs/runtime-apis.mdx',
  url: '/docs/runtime-apis',
  content: {
    title: "Astro's Runtime APIs",
    category: 'Runtime APIs',
    file: '.../src/pages/docs/runtime-apis.mdx',
    url: '/docs/runtime-apis',
    astro: {}
  },
  frontmatter: {...},
  headings: [
    {
      depth: 1,
      slug: 'working-with-astros-toolbox',
      text: 'Working with Astroâ€™s toolbox'
    },
  ],
  'server:root': true
}
```

We can destructure the properties we need to access their values and work with them in a separate Astro component like this:

```jsx
/** LAYOUT: /src/layouts/Page.astro */
---
import TOC from "../component/TOC.astro";
const { headings } = Astro.props;
---

<TOC headings={headings} />

/** COMPONENT: /src/components/TOC.astro */
---
import type { HeadingsType } from "../lib/types";
type Props = HeadingsType;

const { headings } = Astro.props;
---

<ul>
    {headings.map(({ slug, text }) => (
        <li><a href={`#${slug}`}>{text}</a></li>
    ))}
</ul>

```

### Building a Side Navigation

For a side navigation, we do need to read all the files within a given folder in our project. In order to do that, Astro also offers another API for this purpose. `Astro.glob()` is the easiest way to load multiple files into your static site setup. It only takes a single parameter: a relative URL glob of which files you'd like to import.

Each of our `/*.mdx` pages has a title and a category. We'd like to group each page by category and display them in a component for navigation. Let's take a look how we build a Side navigation component using `Astro.blog()`:

```jsx
import type { MDXInstance } from "astro";
import type { DocsType } from "../lib/types";

const pages = (await Astro.glob("../pages/docs/*.mdx")) as Array<
    MDXInstance<DocsType>
>;

const sortedPages = pages.sort((a, b) =>
    a.frontmatter.category.localeCompare(b.frontmatter.category, "en", {
        sensitivity: "base",
    })
);

const categories = [
    ...new Set(pages.map((p) => p.frontmatter.category)),
];
```

Once we have this information gathered, we can dynamically create a component mapping over our categories and creating children if they belong within that given category.

A huge thing to note is that `Astro.glob()` is a wrapper of Vite's `import.meta.glob()` API, and it's only available in `/*.astro` files. In case you need access to your files in other file extension types, you can always use Vite's API (see [Vite's Glob Import](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#glob-import)).
